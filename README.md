Poker planning tool

## Why?

This project is all about helping me get a feel for the __.NET Framework__ and __EF Core__ while dabbling with __Domain-Driven Design__ and __clean code__. Don't expect it to be super-fast, secure, or have every feature under the sun.

Basically, just for learning and messing around!
